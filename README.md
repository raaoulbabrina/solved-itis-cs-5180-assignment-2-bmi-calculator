<h1>In Class Assignment 2</h1>

Today we are building our first Android application. The app is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. To calculate the BMI follow the below equation. The standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults (18 years and above) are shown in the following table.

<table width="347">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="173"><strong>Category</strong></td>

   <td width="173"><strong>BMI</strong></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="173">Underweight</td>

   <td width="173">BMI &lt; 18.5</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="173">Normal or Healthy Weight</td>

   <td width="173">18.5 ≤ BMI &lt; 25</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="173">Overweight</td>

   <td width="173">25 ≤ BMI &lt; 30</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="173">Obese</td>

   <td width="173">30 ≤ BMI</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>
